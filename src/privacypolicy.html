    <h1>How we use information we collect</h1>
    <p>How we use the information we obtain partly depends on which of our Services you use, the manner in which you use them, and any preferences you have communicated to us. Below are the specific purposes for which we use the information we collect about you.</p>
    <p>To provide the Services and personalize your experience: We use the information we have about you to specialize and personalize the Services we provide to you.</p>
    <p>For research and development: We are always looking for ways to improve our Services' speed, security, compatibility, and utility. We use information and feedback about how people use our Services to troubleshoot, locate usage and activity patterns, and overall, improve our Services. We gather and analyze frequently used search terms to improve the accuracy and relevance of suggested topics that auto-populate the search feature.</p>
    <p>To communicate with you about the Services: We use your contact information to email you purchase confirmations, responses to messages, provision of customer support, security alerts, technical updates, and administrative messages.</p>
    <p>Customer support: We use your information to resolve your technical issues, respond to your requests for assistance, and improve our Services. When you give us permission to do so, we can share information with a third party expert for the purpose of responding to support-related requests.</p>
    <p>For safety and security: We use information about you to detect, prevent, and respond to potential or actual security incidents and to monitor and protect against other malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal activity.</p>
    <p>To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights: Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions.</p>
    <p>With your consent: We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above. For example, we may publish testimonials or feature customer stories to promote the Services, if, and only if we have your permission. </p>
    <p>If you give us permission to use information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h1>How we share information we collect</h1>
    <p>We make collaboration tools, and we want them to work well for you. This means sharing information through the Services and with certain third parties. We share information we collect about you in the ways discussed below, including in connection with possible business transfers. We are not in the business of selling information about you to advertisers or other third parties.</p>
    <p>Sharing with third parties: We share information with third parties that help us operate, provide, improve, integrate, customize, support and market our Services.</p>
    <p>With your consent: We share information about you with third parties when you give us consent to do so. For example, we often display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our public websites. With your consent, we may post your name alongside the testimonial. </p>
    <p>Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws; Enforcement of Our Rights: In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including to meet national security requirements, (b) enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) protect the security or integrity of our products and services, (d) protect Aladdin Digital, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person. </p>
    <p></p>
    <h1>How we store and secure information we collect</h1>
    <p>Information storage and security:  We use industry standard technical and organizational measures to secure the information we store. </p>
    <p>While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others.</p>
    <p>How long we keep information: If you message us, the message and its metadata are retained indefinitely.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h1>How to access and control your information</h1>
    <p>You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information. Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations.</p>
    <p>Your Choices: You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, or to request your information in a structured, electronic format. </p>
    <p>Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.</p>
    <p>If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.</p>
    <p>Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations</p>
    <p>Request that we stop using your information: In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so.</p>
    <p>Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time. </p>
    <p>If there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved.</p>
    <p></p>
