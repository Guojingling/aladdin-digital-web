                    <div class="case-accordion__panel">
                        <p>Aladdin was urgently engaged after a local institute lost critical email data during a services upgrade. Aladdin deployed an onsite technician to investigate the cause of the data loss, identify recoverable data and implement a secure cloud-based solution to future-proof its email system.</p>
                        <p>Aladdin restored normal operations with four hours of engagement and recovered 80% of critical lost data before implementing an Azure-based solution with cloud backup, automated archiving and multi-region disaster recovery.</p>
                        <p>The institute has now eliminated manual backups of email and significantly reduced the risk of similar incidents. Aladdin provides quarterly checks of CI’s email environment to ensure ongoing stability. </p>

                    <div class="case-accordion__panel" hidden>
                        <p>Aladdin was engaged to stabilise and enhance a governmental agency’s Lighthouse HR compliance system. Aladdin’s system developer analysed system data, identified incorrect process flows and recurring incidents, clarified missing requirements and implemented a structured action plan. The developer introduced a new IT-led incident management process which included triage and change management workflows, they fixed incidents root causes and provided all relevant documentation support NEMA’s ability to manage the solution internally, long-term. </p>
                        <p>As a result of the actions Aladdin’s system developer took, our client agency is seeing zero recurrences of incidents and a decrease in both responses and incident resolution timeframes. Data synchronisation with SAP has also improved, which has led to increased confidence in the accuracy and reliability of compliance reporting.</p>
