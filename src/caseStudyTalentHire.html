                        <p>Aladdin supported a government agency by recruiting a highly skilled Full Stack Developer for its ICT Migration Project. Aladdin sourced and screened three candidates, shortlisted one, and prepared them for the agency’s interview through technical coaching and role briefing. After confirmation of placement, Aladdin managed onboarding, payroll and compliance checks, and provided ongoing weekly support and performance monitoring. The placed developer successfully delivered key project tasks on time, demonstrated strong integration and development capability and received positive feedback, leading to a contract extension and continued confidence in Aladdin’s recruitment services.</p>
